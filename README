<h1>Before compiling project</h1>
Use the boost_1_42 library by Beman Dawes (2008).
Go to "C:\Program Files\" and create a new directory called 
"boost". Copy and paste boost into that directory. Afterwards you 
should have the following directory structure:
"C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_42".

Now you can use our program with Visual Studio 2008 - enjoy =)

<h1>Demosite</h1>

In Demosite.zip you can find a PHP Script to test the Crawler
